# Project Overview 
This is a comprehensive mobile application developed using Flutter and Dart as a final graduation project for the intensive 120-hour Flutter training program at the National Telecommunication Institute (NTI).

The application serves as a fully functional movie browsing platform, demonstrating modern mobile development practices, professional state management, and robust API integration.

# Key Technologies & Stack 
Framework: Flutter (Developed entirely using Flutter and Dart).

State Management: BLoC (Business Logic Component) for predictable and scalable state handling.

Data Source: External APIs (Used to fetch real-time movie data).

Persistence: Local Database (For storing user-specific data like the favorites list).

Version Control: GitHub (Extensive use for collaborative coding and code review).

Project Management: Jira (Used for agile task management, tracking sprints, and issue resolution).

# Core Features 
Dynamic Movie Listing: Displays popular and trending movies fetched from the API.

Detailed Movie Screens: Provides in-depth information for each movie, including ratings, synopsis, and similar movie recommendations.

Powerful Search: Allows users to quickly search and filter movies by title or genre.

User Feedback: Clear success and error notifications using Toast Notifications.

# Professional Workflow & Collaboration 
The project emphasized industry best practices throughout the development lifecycle:

Agile Management: We utilized Jira to structure the project, organize tasks, and maintain a clear development roadmap.

Code Quality & Review: All features were developed in separate branches, ensuring code quality through Pull Requests (PRs) and collaborative code reviews before merging to the main branch.

Team Delivery: Successfully delivered the project as a cohesive team of four developers, managing conflicts and integrating diverse components efficiently.
